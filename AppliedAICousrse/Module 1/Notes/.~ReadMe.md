# Things to Keep in Mind 

------

1. Here in this section I have uploaded the notes with I have made in module 1 of the applied Ai course
2. The notes are in **doc format** thus you will not be able to open in here but you can download it.
3. I have done it for my convenience that when ever i will update the notes i will commit the changes through the git version control
4. If you are also in the same course you can take help from it.
